#  TIME-IN TIME-OUT ATTENDANCE SYSTEM!!
## Description
   This program is a group project of my Software Engineering I (CS 310) class. This project involves implementing the Time-in time-out
   Attendance System of a local company. This local company has employees whose information is stored in the database (MySQL). This
   information includes their name, badge-id, punch times (clock-in and clock-out times), employee id, shift, punchtype-id, etc.
   The goals of this program are,
   
   1. Adjusting the time punched by an employee which doesn't fall within the shift time
   2. Computing the absenteeism of an employee.
