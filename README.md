#  TIME-IN TIME-OUT ATTENDANCE SYSTEM!!
## Description
   This program is a group project of my Software Engineering I (CS 310) class. This project involves implementing the Time-in time-out
   Attendance System of a local company. This local company has employees whose information is stored in the database (MySQL). This
   information includes their name, badge-id, punch times (clock-in and clock-out times), employee id, shift, punchtype-id, etc.
   The goals of this program are,
   
   1. Adjusting the time punched by an employee which doesn't fall within the shift time
   2. Computing the total number of hours worked by an employee within a given pay period.
   3. Getting the list of all time punches made by an employee within a given pat period.
   2. Computing the absenteeism of an employee.
